<h4> Emotional Intelligence </h4>
<p>
  It was interesting to read about how emotional intelligence had changed the author's life and how it influenced the working area. Using the Navy as an example was a great way to exemplify how it applies to <i>all</i> areas, as opposed to being occupation specific. Although I found the book to be a tad "wordy", it had some interesting points that I had not thought of before. I'm excited to learn and increase my emotional intelligence in the coming weeks (and hopefully for life).

<h4> Two Minutes of Mindfulness </h4>
<p>
  My mind kept wandering quite a lot, and it was difficult to bring it back to my breathing so often I reverted to the "easier" method. I've always wanted to practice meditation so hopefully this is the starting step to that.
