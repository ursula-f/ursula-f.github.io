      Truthfully, I have never devled into the world of meditation very much,
      although quite a few of my friends have. I definitely wasn't opposed to it,
      but rather thought that it wouldn't work for me - that my "type of person"
      was somehow not suitable for meditation. I have always been under the
      impression that my mind wanders too much to truly take advantage of
      meditation or anything similar. However, after reading the second chapter
      of <em> Search Inside Yourself </em>, one of the examples they used is
      exercise. They compared meditation to pumping iron, in that it flexes your
      brain rather than your biceps. It was great to read that it is natural for
      the mind to wander and that it is all part of practicing exercise.

      It was also interesting to read about how meditation doesn't have a
      particular stance (eg. sitting lotus), and that for some people it is
      even possible to walk around in meditation. Now I will just have to find
      whichever position is most comfortable for me.
